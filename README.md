# Yahtzee
This file is for simulating a game of Yahtzee. The computer plays a very simple stupid strategy of just choosing whatever dice they have 
the most of.

Potential future improvements:
  -More sophisticiated way of determing dice to keep
  -More sophisticated way of deciding what to score
  -Allow the computer vs human game
